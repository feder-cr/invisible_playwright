"""Render the Jekyll docs/ tree into a GitHub wiki checkout.

Usage: build_wiki.py <docs_dir> <out_dir> [--pixels <owner/repo>]

A GitHub wiki is a flat set of <Page>.md files with no Jekyll front matter and a
_Sidebar.md for navigation. This converter, for every docs/*.md:
  - strips the YAML front matter (the body already starts with the H1),
  - rewrites internal links [x](slug.md[#a]) -> [x](slug[#a]) (wiki has no .md),
  - names the page by its slug (stable URLs matching the docs site), except
    index.md -> Home.md (the wiki landing page),
  - and, with --pixels, gives the page its view counter (see
    scripts/sync_article_pixels.py for what that number is and is not).
and then generates _Sidebar.md mirroring the parent/has_children/nav_order tree.

The pixel goes into the WIKI only, never back into docs/. The wiki is the
surface that ranks and the surface readers land on; the .md in the repository
is served as a JSON payload React mounts, and a counter there would measure
almost nothing while putting markup into the source tree.

Without --pixels (a local preview) no pixel is written at all, rather than one
addressed to a guessed repository. A wiki published that way would count
nothing while looking entirely normal, so publish-wiki.yml passes the flag AND
runs `sync_article_pixels.py --check` over the output before pushing.
