"""The version a change proposes must not already be on the index.

⛔ MEASURED 2026-09-04, AND NOTHING SAW IT. `aihawk 0.4.0` was published at
23:47. Over the following hours main gained two more changes - verbs for the
session tools, and a `.env` plus a raised dependency floor - while `pyproject`
still said `0.4.0`. So main carried content that was not the content of the
0.4.0 on the index, and no test, gate or workflow had an opinion about it.

The way that goes wrong is quiet, which is why it deserves a gate rather than a
habit. `publish.yml` asks the index first and treats an already-present version
as a deliberate no-op:

    200) present=yes
         "invisible-playwright $VERSION is already on the index. No-op, not a failure."

That is correct for a re-pushed or backfilled tag, and it cannot tell that case
apart from somebody forgetting to bump. So the release would have reported
success and shipped nothing, and the next person to look would find the feature
missing from a version that was tagged, released and green.

PULL REQUESTS ONLY, and that is the whole design. A pull request proposes new
content; if its version is already published, that content can never reach
anybody. On main straight after a release the version IS the published one until
somebody bumps, which is a normal resting state and not a defect, so a check
that ran there would be red for a reason nobody can act on - and a gate that is
red at rest is a gate people learn to skip.

The trade this makes, stated rather than discovered: the first pull request
after a release has to carry a version bump. That matches how this repository
already works, since the change that earns a release is the change that bumps.

Enabled by IPW_CHECK_VERSION, which the `version` CI job sets itself, so it
cannot silently skip the way it does in a local run.
